# Welcome to NightIn NightOut

Welcome to a demo application of Night In and Night Out created by Rakin Bhuiyan! T

## Description

Night In and Night Out application is a party application for those who want to have fun no matter if its outside on the streets of Montreal or inside with their friends! The night out option (Undergoing development) connects to a google API which shows the nearest clubs and bars according to your location. The night in option (prototype ready) guides you to a list of fun drinks your friends can make at home and fun drinking games that you can play indoors!

## Reflection

_What I enjoyed_

- Creating many different handlers and RESTful endpoints for data manipulation.
- Organizaing and creating well rounded functional components.
- Learning BCRYPT and setting up validation.
- Deep diving in conditionally rendering throughout the project and linking them all together from different components.
- Learning and applying many different CSS styling techniques.
- Tackling bugs and resolving issues.
- Discussing ideas with my peers on what could be improved and what could be added.

_Difficulties I Face_

- Cleaning up data from API to be able to use it properly in my application.
- Connecting proper responses from the front-end and the back-end.
- Ensuring proper navigation throughout my application.

_Lessons Learned_

- Incorporating useReducers would have helped in cleaner code when users are choosing favorite drinks and games.
- Learned to optimize our code to ensure easier accessibility across all developers.
- Proper consisten semantics throughout entire applications.

## Next Steps:

- Implement Oauth and allow users to sign in from Google.
- Start development of the NightOut section of the application.
- Use Google Maps API for NightOUt section.
- Incorporate additional styling across application.
- Better navigation for users.
